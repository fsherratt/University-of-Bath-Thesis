\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank:

My supervisor Pejman Iravani for his assistance at every stage while tolerating my constant distractions, despite often being the source.

Sarena Matherson for her endless love and belief through all the ups and downs. That and her not insignificant patience both reading and listening to me explaining my work.

I would also like to thank my friends and family who have provided constant support and encouragement throughout. Additional thanks go to the select few (James Male, Mike Morris, Alex Powell and Oliver Sherratt) who had the honour of proofreading.

Richard tucker for the loan of the sensors and providing me with experience and ideas to effectively use them 

Finally, to Jawaad Bhatti and the staff at Blatchford for help collecting amputee data as well as assistance in understanding the issues and challenges that amputees face and the difficulties involved in developing powered prosthetic devices
