Following the collection of data work was conducted on developing a general purpose \acrshort{lstm} network for classifiying the locomotive mode of a previously unseen user. This work involved work to understand how \acrshort{lstm} networks are able to learn to recognise different locomotive modes. This work was submitted to the Journal Sensors as part of a call for papers on Machine Learning and Multimodal Sensing for Smart Wearable Assistive Robotics. The paper entitled ``Understanding LSTM Network Behaviour of IMU-Based Locomotion Mode Recognition for Applications in Prostheses and Wearables'' was published on the 10\textsuperscript{th} February 2021.

The remainder of this chapter will be the presentation of the paper followed by a short post-commentary. The paper is presented as published and as such contains both the journal and thesis page numbering. The full paper covers thesis pages \the\numexpr\x+2\relax \ to \the\numexpr\x+24\relax.

\section{Post-commentary}
Since being published, this paper has been cites eight times\footnote{as of the 18\textsuperscript{th} January 2022}. A number of these citations have used the paper as an example use case for an \acrshort{lstm} network\cite{Uddin2021, Du2021, Velezguerrero2021, Low2022} and data capture methods\cite{Shin2021, Su2021}.
%\cite{Hamayel2021, Priya2021} Just used as reference for how an LSTM works - weirdly

% What was the big takeaway from this paper - demonstrates the need for personalisation
The outcomes of the paper expressed the need for model personalisation to achieve acceptable performance for novel users. As well as additional testing required to demonstrate the use of these techniques for amputees. These outcomes will be explored further in the subsequent chapters.
