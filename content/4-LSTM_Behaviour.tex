Following the data collection, work began on developing a general-purpose \acrfull{lstm} network for classifying the locomotive mode of a previously unseen user. This involved work to understand how LSTM  networks can recognise different locomotive modes. Once completed, an article entitled ``Understanding LSTM Network Behaviour of IMU-Based Locomotion Mode Recognition for Applications in Prostheses and Wearables'' was submitted to the Journal Sensors. The paper was submitted as part of a call for papers on Machine Learning and Multimodal Sensing for Smart Wearable Assistive Robotics and published on the 10\textsuperscript{th} of February 2021.

The remainder of this chapter will be the presentation of the paper, followed by a short post-commentary. The paper is re-typeset to match the thesis. Page, section and reference numbering has been changed from the published copy.

%\newcommand\x{\value{page}}
 %The paper is presented as published and as such contains both the journal and thesis page numbering. The full paper covers thesis pages \the\numexpr\x+2\relax \ to \the\numexpr\x+24\relax.

\section{Post-commentary}
Since being published, nine papers have cited the article\footnote{as of the 27\textsuperscript{th} January 2022}. A number of these citations have used the paper as an example use case for an \acrshort{lstm} network\cite{Uddin2021, Du2021, Velezguerrero2021, Low2022, Bittibssi2022} and data capture methods\cite{Shin2021, Su2021}.
%\cite{Hamayel2021, Priya2021} Just used as reference for how an LSTM works - weirdly

% What was the big takeaway from this paper - demonstrates the need for personalisation
The paper's outcomes expressed the need for model personalisation to achieve acceptable performance for novel users. It also noted the need for additional testing to demonstrate the suitability of these techniques for amputees. These needs will be explored further in the subsequent chapters.
